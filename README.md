## PLEC - Color 3D Printing

> PLEC (short for `purgeless extruding colorizer`) is a community-driven project to combine the possibilities of 3D printing with sustainability and color- and material-fusing.

### PLEC comprises both printable hardware upgrade parts to your existing 3D printer for Full-Color and multi-material 3D printing and offers the software and firmware required for usage.
